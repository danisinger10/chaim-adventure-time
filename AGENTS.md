# AGENTS.md - Instructions for AI Teammates

## Project Overview
This is a text-based adventure game called "Chaim's Adventure." The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS in a single `index.html` file. It uses the Google Gemini API for content generation and the ElevenLabs API for narration.

## Testing
- This project does not currently have an automated testing suite.
- Before finalizing changes, please manually verify that the application loads and a new game can be started without errors in the browser console.

## Coding Conventions
- All new JavaScript code should adhere to modern ES6+ standards.
- Use clear and descriptive variable names (e.g., `playerState`, `geminiResponse`).
- When modifying the UI, ensure all new elements are styled with Tailwind CSS classes to maintain visual consistency.

## Pull Request Instructions
- The title of the PR should follow the format: `[Feature] A brief description of the change`.
- The PR description should include a short summary of what was added and why.
